# Hit or Miss Fantasy Football

Welcome to the `Hit or Miss` Fantasy Football league!
On behalf of the league I'd like to thank you for joining!

Below you'll find a list of documents that detail the procedures and protocols of the league.

## League Management

First off though, let's discuss the bones of the league.

The league is currently run through ESPN's fantasy football [application][espn].
There is also an app available for [Android][play_store] and [Apple][apple_store] products.

The League is a Dynasty league in which each team may have up to two `franchise` players, colloquially called `keepers`.

The League is a variant of standard scoring in which kickers are ignored.

## League Mission

Create and foster a competitive, fun, and rewarding fantasy football experience in which everyone is treated with the fairness, dignity, and bullshit that they deserve.
