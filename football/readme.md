# Hit or Miss Fantasy Football

Welcome to the `Hit or Miss` Fantasy Football league!
On behalf of the league I'd like to thank you for joining!

Below you'll find a list of documents that detail the procedures and protocols of the league.

## League Management

First off though, let's discuss the bones of the league.

The league is currently run through Sleeper's fantasy football [application][sleeper].
There is also an app available for Android and Apple products.

The League is a Keeper league in which each team may have up to two `franchise` players they can roll-over to the next season, colloquially called `keepers`.

The League is a variant of half-point per reception scoring in which kickers are ignored.

## League Mission

Create and foster a competitive, fun, and rewarding fantasy football experience in which everyone is treated with the fairness, dignity, and bullshit that they deserve.
