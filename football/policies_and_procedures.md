# Hit or Miss - Policies and Procedures

Now let's go over the many different league policies and rulings that help keep the league civil.

## Revisions to League Policy

First, let's cover how league policies can change and how you, the owner, can play a part in it.

### Authority of the LM

The league is run by the LM, who has absolute authority to settle disputes and is the only member of the league with access to the league settings.

The LM can:
-   veto trades
-   determine, enforce, collect, and waive league fees and dues
-   create and delegate positions of authority
-   remove owners
-   call and dismiss meetings of the High Council

The LM cannot, without authority granted by the High Council:
-   act against the will of the High Council
-   manipulate rosters
-   manipulate scores
-   change league policy
-   own multiple teams(except a team in a state of transition, in which case no manipulation of the team is allowed)

Hopefully all of that is straightforward and unnecessary.

### The High Council

The High Council is the will of the owners of the league.

Simply put, it is a formal gathering of a surplus majority of the league owners in which they vote on a particular point of contention in the league.
The High Council must conclude with a majority vote to enact on a dispute of a league policy change.
It is important to note that the High Council may only request a change to league policy, not vote to enable new league policy.
The power to create policy still resides with the LM.

#### Voting

The High Council must vote in such a way as to prove the votes were not forged.
Typically this will be through the league hangouts or in the league message boards.  

The LM may enact a policy change with the approval of the League Ambassador if the they deem the High Council cannot / has not come to a timely conclusion.

##### Majority Vote

The majority vote needed changes with the size of the league.

| League Size | Majority Vote | Surplus Majority |
| --- |:---:|:---:|
| 10 | 6 | 8+ |
| 12 | 7 | 9+ |
| 14 | 8 | 11+ |

### Policy Changes

Policies that have successfully been backed by the High Council will take affect starting in the next season.
Policy updates made before the start of a season (i.e. before the draft) will not take affect until the following season unless there is a unanimous vote to enact the change immediately.

## Rituals

Ahh, the fun part of the league!
This league has a few quirks that make it unique to us.

### The Sack-O

First up is the Sack-O award, popularized by the show `The League`.
The Sack-O is the person who comes in last in the league.
The High Council annually votes on a *punishment* for the Sack-O recipient to perform.

### Polls

Every week, the Poll Master comes up with a new, fun poll for the league to take.
The poll can be about anything and is mandatory for all league members to participate in.
The poll will be posted on the League [Home Page][espn].

### Side Pots

Many in the league wish to raise the stakes of the league.
Rather than increase league dues across the board, owners may participate in any number of side pots.
Side pots may be over a particular game, over a weekend of games, or even the entire fantasy football season, but they **must always pertain to the league and to nothing else**.

-   Side pots are bets amongst willing owners.
-   Each owner in a side pot will contribute the same amount to the side pot.
-   Side pots are winner-take-all.
-   Side pots must be approved and managed by the Bookkeeper.
-   Side pots must pertain solely to the league.
-   Side pots must not encourage tanking or forfeiture of a match.

#### Weekly Side Pots

These side pots are available week in and week out.

- Most Points - $5

#### Trophy Side Pots

Each of the following trophies in the league are also available year long side-pot bets. The bet for a trophy is $15. Trophy pots adhere to the same rules as regular Side-Pots.

- John Cena - Grand Champion
- Points Farmer - Most Points For at season's end
- The Strong Man - Most Points For in a single game
- Lady Luck - Most Points Against at season's end
- The Plumber - Toilet Bowl winner

# Pending High Council Approval

The following are pending review by the High Council

### Cooperstown Vault and Johnny Football Foundation

When a player earns BP, SP, or GP for their efforts in the league, they are paid out of the Cooperstown Vault.
The Vault never runs out of coin.
Players must return all unused coin at the end of each season. Afterwards, coin is paid out as per the end of season awards.

Coins are used to fund individual ventures provided by the `Johnny Football Foundation`.
A owner may spend their hard earned coin at any time to enlist the JFF for a particular task.

#### JFF Tasks

The following is a list of tasks provided by the JFF and their cost.

- Rename a team (1 BP): Until the next waiver reset, the named owner must change their team name.
- Force player pickup (1 SP): The named owner (cannot be the week's opponent) must succeed in acquiring the named FA player by the next Head-to-Head match*.
- Force a trade (1 GP): The named owner must complete a trade before the next Head-to-Head match*.

**NOTICE** Failure to comply with the JFF results in a $5 fine.

**NOTICE** Per the JFF, a `Head-to-Head match` begins on the next Wed after waivers reset.
When determining the next `match` a owner must have at least 5 days to comply.
