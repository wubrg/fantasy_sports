### Bench

There will be 5 bench slots for you to fill.

### IR

There are two roster slots for IR players.
This slot does not count against your roster size.

## Keepers

Keepers officially lock one hour before the draft, but they must be locked two hours prior when an `expansion draft` or `new owner draft` occurs.

A team may have a maximum of two keepers going into the draft, but are not required to keep any players.

Players who did not play last season are ineligible to keep.

Keeper's are discussed more thoroughly on the [draft][draft] page.

## Free Agents

Free Agents are handled with a auction-style waiver wire.

The yearly budget for waiver acquisitions is $100.
The minimum bid is $0.

### Waivers

Waivers are continuous and process daily at 10am central except on Tuesdays, when no waivers are processed.

**Free Agent Auction (Continuous):** Teams will have a specific budget with which they can bid to make player acquisitions and all acquisitions will be done in batches one or more times each week (as specified in the settings).
If a team would like to add a player, that team will bid an amount they are willing to pay. On the next waiver process day, the team with the highest bid will be awarded the player, and the bid will be subtracted from that team's budget.

Players remain on waivers continuously and thus are always subject to bidding.

**NOTICE:** This means that your roster must be game ready at least an hour before each kickoff as acquisitions are halted until the next processing time.

### Trade Deadline

The league adheres to a trade dealine, after which no trades between teams may happen until the start of next season.

The deadline is two weeks prior to the start of playoffs, typically the start of Week 11.
- Week 11: Thursday, Nov 16 2017, 11 AM Central

### Undroppable

This league respects ESPN's Undroppable Player list.
We do this to help make collusion difficult and obvious.
