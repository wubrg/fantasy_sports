### Bench

There will be 5 bench slots for you to fill.

### IR

There is one roster slots for IR players.
This slot does not count against your roster size.

## Keepers

Keepers officially lock one hour before the draft, but they must be locked at least two hours prior when an `expansion draft` or `new owner draft` occurs. The league will however be able to determine when the expansion draft starts on a case-by-case basis.

It is considered a courtesy to provide your keepers one week prior to the draft to allow teams to prepare their draft strategy.

A team may have a maximum of two keepers going into the draft, but are not required to keep any players.

Players who did not play last season are ineligible to keep.

Keeper's are discussed more thoroughly on the [draft][draft] page.

## Free Agents

Free Agents are handled with a auction-style waiver wire.

The yearly budget for waiver acquisitions is $100.
The minimum bid is $0.

### Waivers

Waivers are continuous and process daily at 10am central except on Tuesdays and Sundays, when no waivers are processed.

### Trade Deadline

The league adheres to a trade dealine, after which no trades between teams may happen until the start of next season. The next season officially begins after the draft when all rosters unlock.

The deadline is the start of Week 10.

### Undroppable

This league respects Sleeper's Undroppable Player list.
We do this to help make collusion difficult and obvious.
