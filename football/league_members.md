## Team Requirements

As the owner of a team in `Hit or Miss` there are certain requirements your team must uphold to.

Firstly, your team needs a name.
There will be none of this 'Team Wieberg' nonsense.
Have some fun with it, be clever with it, or don't, just do something with it is all I ask.

Secondly, your team needs a logo.
Repeat everything I said above about your team name and apply it to your logo.

Thirdly, you must try.
Watch the waivers, offer and accept trades, yell at the LM when he's being a dick, set your lineups, yell at Connor when he's making a terrible trade, participate in the league.
Some of these things are mandatory and may come with fines.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Some members of the league have more responsibilities than simply managing their team.

### League Manager

The LM is in charge of overseeing the league and acting in the best interest of the players and the league.
The LM has absolute authority but can be overridden by the league.

### VP of League Management

The VP of LM exists as third axis of control over the LM, along with the League Ambassador. In addition to the below explanation of overruling the LM, the VP and the LA can jointly override a decision by the LM.  It should be noted that the VP and the LA do not have the power to instantiate new rules, simply to veto or adjust rulings by the LM.

The VP will step in as LM when it is appropriate to do so during a leave of absence.

The VP is also in charge of generating stats and diagrams detailing the plot of the league as the season progresses.

### The Bookkeeper

The Bookie is in charge of managing Side Pot bets, collecting the money, and distributing it to the winners.  

### League Ambassador

The Ambassador is in charge of representing the best interests of the owners and policing the tyranny of the LM.
The League Ambassador is the head of the High Council and acts on behalf of the league when they are unable to assemble for a decision.

### League Fool

The League Fool is the previous season's Sack-O award winner.
They suck.
