## Team Requirements

As the owner of a team in `Hit or Miss` there are certain requirements your team must uphold to.

Firstly, your team needs a name.
There will be none of this 'Team Wieberg' nonsense.
Have some fun with it, bash on Trump, bash on me, be clever with it, or don't, just do something with it is all I ask.

Secondly, your team needs a logo.
Repeat everything I said above about your team name and apply it to your logo.

Thirdly, you must try.
Watch the waivers, offer and accept trades, yell at the LM when he's being a dick, set your lineups, yell at Connor when he's making a terrible trade, participate in the weekly poll.
Some of these things are mandatory and come with fines.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Some members of the league have more responsibilities than simply managing their team.

### League Manager

The LM is in charge of overseeing the league and acting in the best interest of the players and the league.
The LM has absolute authority but can be overridden by the league.

### Poll Master

The PM is in charge of crafting a poll during every week of competition.

### Money Collector

The MC is in charge of collecting league fees and dues and distributing awards.

### The Bookkeeper

The Bookie is in charge of managing Side Pot bets, collecting the money, and distributing it to the winners.  

### League Ambassador

The Ambassador is in charge of representing the best interests of the owners and policing the tyranny of the LM.
The League Ambassador is the head of the High Council and acts on behalf of the league when they are unable to assemble for a decision.

### League Fool

The League Fool is the previous season's Sack-O award winner.
They suck.

The is no League Fool currently. They still suck.
