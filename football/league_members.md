## Team Requirements

As the owner of a team in `Hit or Miss` there are certain requirements your team must uphold to.

Firstly, your team needs a name. There will be none of this 'Team Wieberg' nonsense. Have some fun with it, bash on
Trump, bash on me, be clever with it, or don't, just do something with it is all I ask.

Secondly, your team needs a logo. Repeat everything I said above about your team name and apply it to your logo.

Thirdly, you must try. Watch the waivers, offer and accept trades, yell at the LM when he's being a dick, set your lineups, yell at Connor when he's making a terrible trade, participate in the weekly poll. Interact with the other members of the league, it'll be more fun that way. Some of these things are mandatory and come with fines.
