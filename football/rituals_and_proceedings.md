# Hit or Miss - Rituals and Proceedings

Now let's go over the many different league policies and rulings that help keep the league civil.

## Revisions to League Policy

First, let's cover how league policies can change and how you, the owner, can play a part in it.

### Authority of the LM

The league is run by the LM, who has absolute authority to settle disputes and is the only member of the league with
access to the league settings.

The LM can:
-   veto trades
-   determine, enforce, collect, and waive league fees and dues
-   create and delegate positions of authority
-   remove owners
-   call and dismiss meetings of the High Council

The LM cannot, without authority granted by the High Council:
-   act against the will of the High Council
-   manipulate rosters
-   manipulate scores
-   change league policy
-   own multiple teams

Hopefully all of that is straightforward and unnecessary.

### The High Council

The High Council is the will of the owners of the league.

Simply put, it is a formal gathering of a majority of the league owners (7 or more) in which they vote on a particular point of contention in the league. The High Council must conclude with a majority vote to enact on a
dispute or league policy change. A majority vote is 7 or more, in all cases.

The High Council must vote in such a way as to prove the votes were not forged. Typically this will be through the
league hangouts or in the league message boards.  

## Rituals

Ahh, the fun part of the league! This league has a few quirks that make it unique to us.

### The Sack-O

First up is the Sack-O award, popularized by the show `The League`. The Sack-O is the person who comes in last in
the league. The High Council annually votes on a *punishment* for the Sack-O recipient to perform.

### Polls

Every week, the Poll Master comes up with a new, fun poll for the league to take. The poll can be about anything and
is mandatory for all league members to participate in. The poll will be posted on the League [Home Page][espn].

### Side Pots

Many in the league wish to raise the stakes of the league. Rather than increase league dues across the board, owners
may participate in any number of side pots. Side pots may be over a particular game, over a weekend of games, or even the entire fantasy football season, but they **must always pertain to the league and to nothing else**. 

-   Side pots are bets amongst willing owners.
-   Each owner in a side pot will contribute the same amount to the side pot.
-   Side pots are winner-take-all.
-   Side pots must be approved and managed by the Bookkeeper.
-   Side pots must pertain solely to the league.
