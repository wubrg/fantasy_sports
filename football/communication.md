# Hit or Miss - Communication

## Official Announcements

The league uses email to communicate.
Your team should have a email address that is actively monitored so that important
announcements are not missed, nor other important things like trade offers.

## General Chat

The league also has a [Google Hangouts][hangouts] used for more general purpose chats about the league, smack talk and other miscellanea.

The League Manager should send you an invite upon joining the league.

**NOTICE** The hangouts will often discuss revisions to the league policies but **nothing is official until it resides within the documents listed below.**

## Calendar

The League Manager maintains a league calendar that has helpful reminder events for things like lineup set, waivers being opened, etc.
It is encouraged that you follow the league [calendar][calendar].  

## Contact Info

If the league message board or general chat channel does not suffice, you can contact a member directly.
See the [League Members][league_members] page.
