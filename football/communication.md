# Hit or Miss - Communication

## Official Announcements

The league uses email to communicate. Your team should have a email address that is actively monitored so that important
announcements are not missed, nor other such important things like trade offers.

## General Chat

The league also has a [Google Hangouts][hangouts] used for more general purpose chats about the league, smack talk and
other miscellanea.
The hangouts will often discuss revisions to the league policies but **nothing is official until it resides within the
documents listed below.**
