# Hit or Miss - Draft

Synopsis of Hit or Miss draft rules, proceedings and guidelines.

## Draft Format

The draft is an `auction` style. It is done using ESPN's built-in auction draft.

The draft `budget` is $200 for every team, minus the draft value of their keepers, if any.

### Keepers

This league is a dynasty league and each team is allowed to `keep` up to two players on their roster heading into the
next year's draft.

Players carry over their auction value to the next season if they are selected as a keeper. This value increases the
more times a player is selected by the same team.

There is also a minimum value that is enforced on every keeper. Every keeper must cost at least $10. If a player is
selected as a keeper and their previous draft or FA value was less than $10 then they are kept at the higher value of
their previous value + $5 and the league minimum, $10.

#### Keeper pricing

| Keep Count | Previous value | Penalty | New value |
| ---|:---:| ---:|---:|
| First time (under minimum) | $1 | $9 | $10 |
| First time (under minimum) | $7 | $5 | $12 |
| First time | $10 | $5 | $15 |
| Second time | $15 | $10 | $25 |
| Third time | $25 | $15 | $40 |

This keeper pricing strategy  strikes a balance between rewarding players for good foresight but ensures that they do
not hinder the ability for other owners to compete. It also encourages trading as a trade will effectively `reset` the
player's `keep count`

## Addendum

### Expansion Draft

When the league expands to include more players there is a special draft before the full auction draft. The draft is for
outfitting the new teams with keepers of their own, should they wish to have them.

The process is as follows:
-   Existing teams lock in their keepers
-   All other players are released to the FA pool
-   New owners snake draft their keepers from the FA pool (order determined randomly)
-   Regular auction draft begins

The purpose of this draft is to give new teams a chance to start on equal footing with existing teams and to add their
own personal touch to their team before entering the draft.

Players selected in the snake draft `will` count against the starting auction budget of $200 based on the keeper rules
noted above. They are treated as `first time keepers` for the new teams.

It is `not` required that new teams select any keepers in the snake draft.
