# Hit or Miss - Draft

Synopsis of Hit or Miss draft rules, proceedings and guidelines.

## Draft Format

The draft is an `auction` style.
It is done using Sleeper's built-in auction draft.

The draft `budget` is $200 for every team, minus the draft value of their keepers, if any.

### Keepers

This league is a dynasty league and each team is allowed to `keep` up to two players on their roster heading into the next year's draft.

Players carry over their auction value to the next season if they are selected as a keeper.
This value increases the more times a player is selected as a keeper.

There is also a minimum value that is enforced on every keeper.
Every keeper must cost at least $10.
If a player is selected as a keeper and their previous draft or FA value was less than $10 then they are kept at the higher value of their previous value + $5 and the league minimum, $10.

#### Keeper pricing

- First year keepers are last year's draft cost +$5, minimum $10.
- Second year keepers are +$10, third year are +$15.
- Undrafted players (i.e., free agent pickups) are the $10 minimum.

| Keep Count | Previous value | Penalty | New value |
| ---|:---:| ---:|---:|
| First time (under minimum) | $1 | $9 | $10 |
| First time (under minimum) | $7 | $5 | $12 |
| First time | $10 | $5 | $15 |
| Second time | $15 | $10 | $25 |
| Third time | $25 | $15 | $40 |

This keeper pricing strategy aims to strike a balance between rewarding players for good foresight but ensures that they do not hinder the ability for other owners to compete.

## Addendum

### Expansion Draft

When the league expands to include more players there is a special draft before the full auction draft.
The draft is for outfitting the new teams with keepers of their own, should they wish to have them.

The process is as follows:
-   Existing teams lock in their keepers
-   All other players are released to the FA pool
-   New owners snake draft their keepers from the FA pool (order determined randomly)
-   Team auction budgets are adjusted.
-   Regular auction draft begins

The purpose of this draft is to give new teams a chance to start on equal footing with existing teams and to add their
own personal touch to their team before entering the draft.

Players selected in the snake draft `will` count against the starting auction budget of $200 based on the keeper rules
noted above.

It is `not` required that new teams select any keepers in the snake draft.

### New Owner Draft

New owner, or replacement owner, drafts will be handled similarly to expansion drafts.
A key difference here is that new owners will not begin with 2 full keepers.

The process is as follows:
-   Existing teams lock in their keepers
-   All other players (including the new owner's team) are released to the FA pool
-   New owners draft their keeper from the FA pool (order determined randomly)
-   Team auction budgets are adjusted.
-   Regular auction draft begins
