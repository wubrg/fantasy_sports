# Week 3


## Adam vs Sam

**_The Bro Off_**

Battle of the Bros. We mutually agreed to love each other despite who won but also, I could give a shit about this game because Clyde FINALLY DID SOMETHING!!!!! Sam wins on the back of the return of OBJ and entirely too many points from the Cardinals Defense who managed to score a shit ton while also giving James Robinson all the things his heart desired. Congrats bro. Until we meet again...

0-2 vs 2-0 to Sam

## Jasenko vs Brandon

**_Match of the Week_**

Dalvin was out and it didn't even matter, son. Get it? Mattin-son, matter son... Okay, that was a bad pun. FINE! It was awful. Coincidentally, that's probably how Brandon feels just narrowly missing out on the head to head win AND the median win thanks to a Tyler Lockett special and some baaad JuJu. Jasenko started Mark Ingram and Kelce didn't even score 20 which breaks his streak of 9 consecutive weeks over 20+! and Jasenko still won a narrow victory on the backs of Alexander Mattinson and Mike "Beast Mode" Williams.... Brandon, I feel ya buddy, fantasy can be a cruel cruel mistress.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Jasenko

## Michael vs Connor

**_The Don't Tell Me The Odds Game_**

I think the recap summed this one up pretty nicely. As long as your name is Michael anyways.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Michael

## Dakota vs Mike

**_The Did We Just Become Best Friends Game_**

Aaron Rodgers game winning drive and swagger. Check. Davonte Adams dominating. Check. Jamaar Chase two touchdown game. Obviously. Everything was going alright for Dakota. But then... Gronk took the hit of his life, and I don't mean the good kind. And just like that Dakota's fortune changed. All of a sudden the two-man performance by Josh Allen and Alvin Kamara that had seemed so beatable now looked like a long shot. And all hope rested on Miles Sanders against a sus Cowboys defense. And he got 67% of the work! Dakota wins, Dakota wins! Oh wait, he got 2 carries and the Eagles got clowned by Cowboys and actually Mike won this week.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Mike

## Cody vs Nick

**_Battle of the Browns_**

Fantasy is a cruel mistress indeed. Cody gets the big game from the QB he didn't want and Zeke turns out in style as the RB 1 overall. But Cody has Nick Chubb and Nick has Kareem Hunt and it just kind of felt like that was what it would come down to and all that was going to matter. Turns out, that's basically what happened. Sure Cody lost Sterling Shepard mid-game but the game of which Brown scored the touch... down was what mattered in the end. Nick stays perfect. Keep flexing Nick, you're the only undefeated left!

1-1 vs 2-0 to Nick

## Bobby vs Dan

The plague has found its cure. Bobby is off to a hot start after this week locking up the 2-0 with a solid performance over Dan, who seems to be Adam Gase-ing an otherwise stellar lineup with his belief in the Sunset Golden Locks of Trevor Lawrence against good defenses. And yes, I am calling the Cardinals a good defense; it's amazing what a Watt brother can do for a defense. But truthfully, I only rag on Dan here because I tried to trade for Saquan and he (smartly) rejected my advances. So of course Barkley showed out this week for him. Unfortunately, Bobby had more to show this week with his unveiling of Najee Harris, your soon to be Reception leader for 2021. I mean, can Ben even throw the ball past the LOS?

2-0 vs 0-2 to Bobby
