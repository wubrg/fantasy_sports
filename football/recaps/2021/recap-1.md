# WE ARE BACK!!! WEEKLY RECAPS ARE BACK THIS YEAR!!
Last year just didn't feel right without em, so I'm gonna suck it up and give the league what they didn't ask for. We're a little more organized in some areas this year and a little less in others. Discord is our go to for all things and I'll post the weekly recaps exclusively into this channel.

Some small announcements: We made a scoring update to fumbles to correct them to only punish players for Lost Fumbles. If you find anything else that looks wrong with waivers, scoring, etc please reach out and make some noise about it and we'll get it figured out.

With that out of the way let's get into the matches!

## Adam vs Cody
Starting things off with my matchup with Cody because I'm selfish as heck. Honestly I felt really good about this after watching Tom Brady and Gronk play 10 years younger against Pass Pro Specialist Zeke and the Cowboys. Next thing I know and Cody is going apeshit on me and I can't buy a touchdown until Sunday Night. Adding fuel to the fire, Adam Thielen is somehow not dead and wins the Justin Jefferson vs Thielen battle, which I can't decide if I'm happy or sad about. On the one hand Adam is more likely to get covid, but also more likely to get touchdowns... It's a hard knock life. Cody walks away with a full Chubb in this one, while Adam is Thielen the pain. 2-2 to 0-2

## Mike vs Dan
I'm not gonna lie. This game does not look fun to recap. Mike choosing to start all available options for the Broncos and Bills did not pan out quite as planned. It was better than Dan's strategy to rely on the Texans being more god-awful than the Urban Meyer Crime Family led Jaguars however, and given the shots fired by Dan's "Bills Suck" team name, it seems only fitting. Ultimately not many players came to play this week for Mike or Dan, but Mike didn't completely drop the ball thanks to the reliable hands of Nelson Agholor. 1-1 to 0-2

## Dakota vs Bobby
What a kick to the nuts. Dakota comes in after the draft just swinging his nuts around starting two tight ends and Mr "I can't see the ball", Jamar Chase. And it worked! But Mahomes had other plans and that's ultimately the difference in this match. Bobby went blow for blow, with Deebo matching Tyreek, Higgins pacing Chase, and then Mahomes came and gave Rodgers the discount double check and sealed it for Bobby. Let's hope this performance is as contagious and effective as Bobby's luck last year. 1-1 to 2-0

## Jasenko vs Michael
The West Coast Worst Coast Match of the Week game! Being a niners fan is nothing but pain, and relying on them in fantasy is the 10th level of Hell according to Dante (Pettis). Mostert was finally going to get the bellcow work and he made it all of 2 carries. Aiyuk was a healthy scratch bc Kyle wanted to send a message to his Reception Perception darling. The result is Michael Barely squeaking by a win over Jasenko. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL FOLKS! On the cusp of beating the median with the median-est of scores #playingittight, Michael watched Lamar choke harder than Derrick Carr eating anything other than Wallerus meat. Let's not overshadow what Jasenko had going for him though, which was basically everything except his RB2 and Ryan Tannehill, who somehow made the Cardinals defense look like last years Rams. Nobody is happy after this matchup. 0-2 to 1-1

## Connor vs Brandon
So I know the above was the match of the week but Brandon and Connor also had a barn burner that came down to the wire. I don't know if I've seen a matchup that looks so completely even in all my life. You can basically pit players against their counterparts and see them score the same down the line. Hurts vs Dak - ~28 points. Mixon vs Swift 23-20 points. Ekler vs Carson ~11 points. AB vs Lockett 21-24 points, etc. Ultimately Brandon takes it on the chin as the Ravens defense gets Jayce Frost'ed in OT and Brandon takes to 2-0 to 0-2 swing. Connor rejoices and is still drunk from his celebration. 2-0 to 0-2

## Sam vs Nick
Family Feud time. It's wiffle-ball all over again and neither team held back. Sam started and ended hot with big performances from Amari Cooper and Darren Waller, but it was all for not. Kyler and Nuk connected twice in their rout of the Titans and Melvin Gordon showed that he can still run in a straight line real good. It's gonna haunt Sam that he had Jamaal Williams... Speaking of, do yourself a favor and watch every interview of Jamaal Williams ever... sitting on his bench despite Dan Campell's clear desire to feed that man some kneecaps against a defenseless 49ers defense. Nick steals round one with a 2-0, but unlike last year, Sam still comes away with a win despite Nick's bigger bat. 1-1 to 2-0
