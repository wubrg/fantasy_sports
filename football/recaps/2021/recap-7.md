# Week 7

Announcements

Trade deadline is approaching. The second IR slot is for Covid-19 IR only. 

## Adam vs Dakota

The rookie wookies fuck me. Chase and Pitts are good. My team is bad.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Dakota

## Jasenko vs Sam

It was a rough weekend for Sam. This OBJ guy might have finally fallen off the cliff. This Michael Pittman guy though... shiiiiiit. And no, we're not going to talk about AJ Brown against the Chiefs tiny corners here.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Jasenko

## Michael vs Nick

This is exactly what we needed. Nick picking up the Brown's leading running back. When will someone beat this mfer. Meanwhile, Michael is still clinging to Aiyuk which is further proof that you can't help who you love. Bless your sweet little heart, Michael.

1-1 vs 2-0 to Nick

## Connor vs Dan

Dan... Ouchtown population you bro. Been there. Connor is quietly putting together a team that has a chance... Don't tell Michael.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Connor

## Cody vs Bobby

**_Match of the Week_**

No chubbs were felt in this match. Both teams were full of posers, with each quarterback trying their hardest to play the worst football imaginable. Lucky for Bobby, Deebo is still healthy and that Cody whiffed on starting Shepard.


0-2 vs 1-1 to Bobby

## Mike vs Brandon

Old Kamara vs New Kamara. A Dante Pettis sighting and the classic 3 TD game from Mike Evans. Brandon, its gonna be another week before you can catch me.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Mike
