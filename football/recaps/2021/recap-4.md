# Week 4

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

We're four weeks in and its time to check everyone's pulse and see whose good, bad, and in the immortal words of Whoopi Goldberg, uuuuuugly.

## Adam vs Connor

Speaking of ugly, check out Adam's team. It looks a little better with Gaskin off and Murray and Patterson and Carter all trending up but its still a bunch of question marks at running back and a couple of young stud WRs. Connor's team however is gud good.

This match was a slugfest as Adam's team decided to show some life. Apparently that came at the expense of Brady's weekly blood transfusion and completely empty Gaskin. Austin Ekler earned his nickname by being awesome on Monday Night Football and Adam's hopes were dashed. But at least we're on the fucking scoreboard now.

1-1 vs 2-0 to Connor

## Jasenko vs Mike

Speaking of the scoreboard, someone forgot to tell Jasenko's team they were supposed to score. Dalvin, Kelce, and Mike Williams all stunk it up. I'm not ready to call Jasenko's team Bad though, so he's gonna start at Good while he weathers these tumultuous waters. Mike however is getting an UGLY simply because he's trying to start only Bills and Broncos. This isn't a nature preserve, its football. Also I hate both of those teams. But at least the Bills are good though, and I'm not scared at all of the Chiefs Bills matchup this coming weekend.

1-1 vs 0-2 to Jasenko

## Michael vs Dan

While we're on the topic of things that are ugly... I'm just kidding Dan, I think your team is squarely in the GOOD category after this week and the return of SaQUAD. Michael on the other hand is definitely trending ugly despite some big time wins at the backend of his roster (looking at you Cooper Kupp). Injuries are piling up for Michael, let's see if the second quarter of the season will treat him any better. For now though we'll call it like it is, and it's bad.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Dan

## Nick vs Bobby

**_Match of the Week_**

Both of these teams are good and their records are proving it. Some hiccups from team Heisman this week proved fatal as Bobby was ready to pounce with the two obvious best players in the NFL. Patrick Mahomes and DEEBO MOTHERFUCKING SAMUEL. Seriously what is going on with Deebo and why hasn't he been injured yet. He's like the only healthy player on the niners right now. Olympus has fallen and there are no more undefeated teams. Get rekt Nick.

1-1 vs 2-0 to Bobby

## Sam vs Dakota

I've really done everything I can to protect you from heartache, Sam. We've got the median match this year. We've got the bad luck trophy as well and yet you still seem to always find the buzzsaw. This week it wasn't Lockett and Murray dropping 100 on you but the third touchdown to Tyreek in garbage time had to feel like a punch to the gut of the testicles. And then Monday night pushes you out of the median win... Damn. All of this is to say that I'm giving both teams a GOOD rating. They're both solid up and down and will always be in on the action week in and week out barring any (more) injuries.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Dakota

## Cody vs Brandon

Oh dear, oh my. I'm so sorry Brandon. I wanted us to escape the geese together but fate had other plans. Never fear though as you are not alone in the UGLY category. I still have hope for the both of us though IF SOME OF OUR PLAYERS CAN WAKE THE FUCK UP AND PLAY SOME GOD DAMNED FANTASTIC FOOTBALL ALREADY that would be great. Cody on the other hand is looking good though he's on some thin ice. We'll see how things shake out over these next four weeks.

1-1 vs 0-2 to Cody

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Good - Connor, Jasenko, Dan, Nick, Bobby, Sam, Dakota, Cody
