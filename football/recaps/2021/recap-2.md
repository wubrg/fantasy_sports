# Week 2

## Adam vs Nick

**_The Derrick Fucking Henry Game_**

You know... they say that eating more vegetables, and perhaps even eating _only_ vegetables is supposed to be good for you. That's what Tom Brady (heretofore, Mr. Goatface) does. But unlike Mr Goatface, Adam's team cannot survive on only the production of "vegetables". At some point there needs to be a balanced diet, some MEAT, some DERRICK FUCKING HENRY, God damnit. Adam fumbles away the median game after getting stiffed by Derrick Henry and the little invisible magician in Arizona.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Nick

## Mike vs Bobby

So Mike wins this head to head but there is an ominous portent hidden within this victory. Alvin Kamara does not enjoy his new ownership. The Bills however do enjoy a Tua-less Miami dolphins and Mike Evans appears to have taken Gronk's redzone usage as an affront to his mother, scoring 2 touchdowns in the rout of the Falcons. It wasn't enough however to get him over the median score. Which brings us to Bobby, who... well... it just wasn't Bobby's week. Not to say that Bobby's team was bad, but Bobby was missing that _one_ bit of _extra_ this week. I feel for you Bobby, fellow owner of bad looking first round running backs.

1-1 vs 0-2 to Mike

## Dakota vs Dan

**_Match of the Week_**

Waiting all day for Monday Night! This one came down to the Lions and Packers Monday night game and honestly, it was not a game that should have been close. Aaron Jones is a really good football player though and Dakota's Pack Stack of Rodgers and Adams did not stand a chance next to Hockenson (heretofore Hercules) and Aaron Jones. Jones manages to steal three of Rodgers four touchdowns, while Adams fails to get even one despite dominating the Lions. Hercules, however, does completes his task of finding the endzone sealing Dakota's twist of fate. Fortunately, Dakota was able to just barely beat the median thanks to the second greatest TE in NFL history.

1-1 vs 2-0 to Dan

## Jason vs Connor

**_Battle of the Browns_**

AJ Brown and Antonio Brown faced off in this friendly head-to-head but really neither of them did anything of note in their games. Instead it was predictably a battle of the studs. Dalvin Cook and Austin Ekler traded blows. Diggs and Ridley mutual'd each other and Travis Kelce and Damien Harris put up probably the two best plays of the year. This one was a slugfest and it came down to the old adage, _defense wins championships_. Specifically, the Patriots and their dismantling of Zach Wilson's psyche. Add a little bit of love from Corey Davis and Jason locked up the 2-0 this week.

2-0 vs 0-2 to Jason

## Michael vs Brandon

While Michael bithces and moans with Sam about their investment into the Niners backfield, we're all missing the fact that Michael is crushing it. CMC, Kupp, and Cooks are taking no prisoners this year as they are out to a scorching hot start. The same was being said about Dak and the Cowboys offense, but Dak was a no show and George Kittle is washed (sup Michael). But as they say, its on to next week now. Its all us 0-4ers can do. 

2-0 vs 0-2 to Michael

## Sam vs Cody

**_Wet Noodle Fight_**

I decided to check into how many touchdowns, turnovers, and what team defenses were doing for everybody precisely for games like this. Sam and Cody combined for six total touchdowns this week, and Sam had just two of them. The Wieberg brothers continue to find ways to suffer in 2021. Cody however managed to grind out a respectable score and beat the median for the sweet sweet 2-0 on the back of his namesakes, Thielen and Chubb. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious. Zeke is the wet noodle compared to Tony Pollard, the Bazooka Gun Super Soaker Double Pump Clutch Water Blaster Shotgun of running backs.

0-2 vs 2-0 to Cody
