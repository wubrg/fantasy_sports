# Hit or Miss - League Fees and Dues

The league is a pay to play league.
There are dues to join for a season and there are penalties for behavior unbecoming
a member of the league.

Since there is money involved there are also payouts!

## Membership Dues

The yearly dues for the league is a single Silver Point ($30).

Dues are paid before the first game of the season.

Dues are paid to the Money Collector via a traceable form of payment like Google Wallet, VenMo, Square Cash, or PayPal.

## Fees and Fines

## Payout

There are ample ways to make your money back or even earn money in the league.

Before we start, let's discuss the basic currency of the league.

| Currency | Value |
| --- |:---:|
| Bronze Point | $15 |
| Silver Point | $30 |
| Gold Point | $60 |

League currency is used to help simplify payouts because math is hard for some people.
But its also used to fund other league ventures. Be sure to keep track of how much of each coin you have!

The Toilet Bowl has two parts, the winner's bracket and the loser's bracket.
The Toilet Bowl produces one undefeated team and one defeated team.
The undefeated is the Toilet Bowl Champion, and the defeated (loses every match) is the winner of the Sack-O award.
