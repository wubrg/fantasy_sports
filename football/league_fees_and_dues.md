# Hit or Miss - League Fees and Dues

The league is a pay to play league. There are dues to join for a season and there are penalties for behavior unbecoming
a member of the league.

 Since there is money involved there are also payouts!

## Membership Dues

The yearly dues for the league are a single Silver $30.

Dues are paid before the first game of the season.

Dues are paid to the Money Collector via a traceable form of payment like Google Wallet, VenMo, Square Cash, or PayPal.

## Fees and Fines

## Payout

There are ample ways to make your money back or even earn money in the league.

Before we start, let's discuss the basic currency of the league.

### Playoffs

The playoffs will start in week 13 and end in week 16.

The top 4 teams will make the playoffs, with each conference champion earning a bye in the first round.

| Place | Award |

| First place: 'The Grand Champion' | ??? |
| Second Place: 'The First of the Worst'| ??? |
| Third Place: 'The One Nobody Remembers' | ??? |

### Toilet Bowl

The remaining teams will enter into the Toilet Bowl, a competition to prove that you didn't actually suck at this.
The Toilet Bowl also determines the Sack-O. The bottom two teams get an automatic `bye` into the loser's bracket.

The Toilet Bowl has two parts, the winner's bracket and the loser's bracket. The Toilet Bowl produces one
undefeated team and one defeated team. The undefeated is the Toilet Bowl Champion, and the defeated (loses every
match) is the winner of the Sack-O award.

| Place | Award |

| Toilet Bowl Champion: 'The Shit Eater' | ??? + League Fees |
| The Sack-O | Becomes the League Fool |
